# DESCRIPTION:  This file manages the PATH environment variable in a clean and
#               maintainable way. It adds directories to the path only if
#               they exist, preventing clutter and potential errors.
#
# ==============================================================================

#
# Prepend a directory to the PATH, but only if it exists.
#
# @param $1 The directory to prepend to the PATH.
#
prepend_to_path() {
  if [ -d "$1" ]; then
    PATH="$1:$PATH"
  fi
}

#
# Add the project's bin directory for the `fc` command.
#
prepend_to_path "$DOTFILES_DIR/bin"

#
# Add the user's local bin directory to the PATH.
#
prepend_to_path "$HOME/.local/bin"

#
# Add Homebrew's binary path.
#
prepend_to_path "/usr/local/bin"

#
# Export the modified PATH.

# Clean up the helper function so it doesn't pollute the global scope.
