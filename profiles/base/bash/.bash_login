# FILE:         .bash_login
#
# DESCRIPTION:  This file is executed for login shells if .bash_profile is
#               not found. Like .bash_profile, its primary purpose is to
#               load the user's shell configuration from .bashrc.
#
# ==============================================================================

#
# Check if .bashrc exists and is readable, then source it.
#
if [ -f "$HOME/.bashrc" ]; then
  source "$HOME/.bashrc"
