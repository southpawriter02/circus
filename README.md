# Dotfiles Flying Circus

## 🎪 A Fully-Featured, Modular, and Well-Documented macOS Dotfiles Repository

This repository serves as a central location for all files and scripts needed to configure a new macOS device from scratch. It is designed to be modular, easy to understand, and simple to extend.

### Core Principles

*   **Modular:** Configurations are broken down into small, self-contained files by topic (e.g., `git`, `vim`, `zsh`).
*   **Documented:** Every script and function is thoroughly documented to explain its purpose and usage.
*   **Automated:** The `install.sh` script automates the entire setup process, from installing dependencies to symlinking dotfiles.
*   **Idempotent:** The installation script can be run multiple times without causing issues.

### Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

*   `bin/`: Executable scripts that should be available in the `PATH`.
*   `completions/`: Shell completion scripts for various tools.
*   `docs/`: Additional documentation.
*   `etc/`: Miscellaneous configuration files, such as `Brewfile`.
*   `lib/`: Shared library functions to be sourced by other scripts.
*   `profiles/`: Core shell profiles (e.g., `.zshrc`).
*   `system/`: System-specific configurations (e.g., macOS defaults).
*   `topics/`: Topic-specific configurations that are loaded by the main shell profile.

### Installation

To install, simply run the main installer script:

```bash
./install.sh
```

The installer will guide you through the process, which includes:
1.  Backing up your existing dotfiles.
2.  Installing Homebrew and necessary packages from the `Brewfile`.
3.  Setting up macOS defaults.
4.  Symlinking the dotfiles into your home directory.
