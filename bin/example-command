# FILE:         bin/example-command
#
# DESCRIPTION:  This is an example of a standalone command that can be placed
#               in the 'bin' directory. Because 'bin' is added to the PATH by
#               the shell configuration, this script can be run simply by
#               typing its name.
#
# ==============================================================================

# --- Initialization ---------------------------------------------------------
# Source the centralized initialization script to set up the environment.
source "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/../lib/init.sh"

# --- Main Logic -------------------------------------------------------------
