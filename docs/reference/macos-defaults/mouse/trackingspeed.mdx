# Mouse Tracking Speed

Control how fast the cursor moves relative to mouse movement.

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Domain** | `NSGlobalDomain` |
| **Key** | `com.apple.mouse.scaling` |
| **Type** | Float |
| **Default Value** | `3` |
| **Our Setting** | `3` |

## Description

Tracking speed determines how far the cursor moves relative to physical mouse movement. Higher values mean the cursor moves farther for the same physical distance. Setting to -1 disables acceleration entirely (linear movement).

## Values

| Value | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| `0.0` | Slowest (low sensitivity) |
| `1.5` | Moderate |
| `3.0` | Default (balanced) |
| `-1` | No acceleration (linear) |

## Understanding Acceleration

### With Acceleration (normal)

- Slow mouse movement = precise cursor
- Fast mouse movement = faster cursor (amplified)
- Adapts to your intent

### Without Acceleration (value = -1)

- Consistent 1:1 movement ratio
- Same physical distance = same cursor distance
- Preferred by some gamers and designers

## Our Configuration

**Set to**: `3` — Default balanced tracking.

### When to Adjust

**Increase speed for**:
- Large displays (4K, 5K)
- Multi-monitor setups
- Faster navigation preference

**Decrease speed for**:
- Precision work
- Users new to mice
- Small screens

**Disable acceleration for**:
- Gaming (muscle memory consistency)
- Graphic design
- CAD work

## Code Examples

```bash
# Read current value
defaults read NSGlobalDomain com.apple.mouse.scaling

# Set to default speed
defaults write NSGlobalDomain com.apple.mouse.scaling -float 3

# Set faster tracking
defaults write NSGlobalDomain com.apple.mouse.scaling -float 4

# Set slower tracking
defaults write NSGlobalDomain com.apple.mouse.scaling -float 1.5

# Disable mouse acceleration (linear/gaming mode)
defaults write NSGlobalDomain com.apple.mouse.scaling -float -1

# Delete (reset to default)
defaults delete NSGlobalDomain com.apple.mouse.scaling
```

## UI Location

**System Settings** → **Mouse** → **Tracking speed** slider

The slider doesn't show the exact value—Terminal provides precise control.

## Related: Trackpad Speed

For trackpad, use a different key:

```bash
# Trackpad tracking speed
defaults write NSGlobalDomain com.apple.trackpad.scaling -float 3
```

## Gaming Mode

For consistent aiming in games:

```bash
# Disable acceleration completely
defaults write NSGlobalDomain com.apple.mouse.scaling -float -1

# May also need per-game settings for some titles
```

Some games override system settings, so check game preferences too.

## DPI vs Tracking Speed

| DPI (hardware) | Tracking Speed (software) |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| Set on mouse | Set in macOS |
| Physical sensitivity | Software multiplier |
| Often 800-3200 | 0.0 to -1 |

For gaming, higher DPI + lower tracking often preferred.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Cursor too fast | Lower the value |
| Cursor too slow | Increase the value |
| Inconsistent speed | Set to -1 for linear |
| Changed after update | Reconfigure via Terminal |

## Apple Mouse vs Third-Party

Different mice may feel different at same setting:
- Apple Magic Mouse has built-in gestures
- Third-party mice may have their own drivers
- Some gaming mice have dedicated software

## Checking Current Value

```bash
# See all mouse settings
defaults read NSGlobalDomain | grep -i mouse
```

## Compatibility

- **macOS**: All versions
- **Mice**: All USB and Bluetooth mice
- **DPI**: 400-16000+ depending on mouse hardware

## Source File

**File**: [`defaults/accessibility/pointer.sh`](../../../defaults/accessibility/pointer.sh)

```bash
run_defaults "NSGlobalDomain" "com.apple.mouse.scaling" "-float" "3"
```
