# Double-Click Speed

Set the time interval for double-click recognition.

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Domain** | `NSGlobalDomain` |
| **Key** | `com.apple.mouse.doubleClickThreshold` |
| **Type** | Float |
| **Default Value** | `0.5` |
| **Our Setting** | `0.5` |

## Description

Double-click speed determines how quickly you must click twice for macOS to recognize it as a double-click. The value is measured in seconds—a lower value requires faster clicking, while a higher value allows more time between clicks.

## Values

| Value | Speed Required |
|-------|----------------|
| `0.0` | Instant (nearly impossible) |
| `0.25` | Very fast |
| `0.5` | Default (moderate) |
| `0.75` | Slower |
| `1.0` | Very slow |
| `1.5` | Maximum (very generous) |

## Visual Representation

```
Time between clicks:
├─ 0.0s ──────┼─ 0.5s ──────┼─ 1.0s ──────┼─ 1.5s ─→
   │              │              │              │
   └─ Too fast    └─ Default     └─ Slow        └─ Max
```

## Our Configuration

**Set to**: `0.5` — Default moderate speed.

### When to Adjust

**Decrease (faster) for**:
- Experienced users
- Gaming
- Speed-focused workflows

**Increase (slower) for**:
- Motor skill difficulties
- Users with tremors
- Children learning mouse use
- Those who accidentally trigger double-clicks

## Code Examples

```bash
# Read current value
defaults read NSGlobalDomain com.apple.mouse.doubleClickThreshold

# Set to default (0.5 seconds)
defaults write NSGlobalDomain com.apple.mouse.doubleClickThreshold -float 0.5

# Set faster double-click (0.25 seconds)
defaults write NSGlobalDomain com.apple.mouse.doubleClickThreshold -float 0.25

# Set slower double-click (1.0 seconds)
defaults write NSGlobalDomain com.apple.mouse.doubleClickThreshold -float 1.0

# Delete (reset to default)
defaults delete NSGlobalDomain com.apple.mouse.doubleClickThreshold
```

## UI Location

**System Settings** → **Accessibility** → **Pointer Control** → **Double-click speed** slider

Slider ranges from "Slow" to "Fast" without showing the exact value.

## Testing Double-Click Speed

Test with Finder:
1. Click once on a file to select
2. Wait briefly
3. Click again
4. If it opens, it registered as double-click
5. If it starts renaming, clicks were too slow

## Accidental Double-Clicks

If you frequently trigger double-clicks accidentally:

```bash
# Increase the threshold (slower double-click)
defaults write NSGlobalDomain com.apple.mouse.doubleClickThreshold -float 0.75
```

This requires more deliberate double-clicking.

## Single-Click Alternatives

Reduce need for double-clicking:

| Action | Alternative |
|--------|-------------|
| Open file | ⌘O after selecting |
| Open folder | Press Enter |
| Rename | Press Enter after selecting |
| Open with default app | ⌘↓ |

## Effect on Triple-Click

Triple-click (select paragraph) timing scales with double-click setting. Slower double-click = more time for triple-click.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Double-clicks not registering | Decrease threshold value |
| Accidental double-clicks | Increase threshold value |
| Inconsistent behavior | Check mouse hardware |

## Mouse Hardware

Some mice have:
- Double-click buttons (single press = double-click)
- Debounce settings in driver
- Programmable click speed

These may interact with system settings.

## Compatibility

- **macOS**: All versions
- **Applies to**: All mouse and trackpad clicks
- **Note**: Some apps may override with custom handling

## Source File

**File**: [`defaults/accessibility/pointer.sh`](../../../defaults/accessibility/pointer.sh)

```bash
run_defaults "NSGlobalDomain" "com.apple.mouse.doubleClickThreshold" "-float" "0.5"
```
