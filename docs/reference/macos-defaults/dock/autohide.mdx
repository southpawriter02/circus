# autohide

Automatically hide and show the Dock.

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Domain** | `com.apple.dock` |
| **Key** | `autohide` |
| **Type** | Boolean |
| **Default Value** | `false` |
| **Our Setting** | `false` |
| **Requires Restart** | Dock restart |

## Description

Controls whether the Dock automatically hides when not in use. When enabled, the Dock slides off-screen to maximize available screen space and only reappears when you move the cursor to the edge of the screen where the Dock is positioned.

Auto-hide is popular among users who want maximum screen real estate, especially on smaller displays like laptops. However, it adds a small delay when accessing the Dock.

## Values

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `true` | **Auto-hide enabled** — Dock slides off-screen when not in use, reappears on mouse hover at screen edge |
| `false` | **Always visible** (default) — Dock remains on screen at all times |

## Default Behavior

**Apple's default**: `false` (Dock always visible)

The Dock is pinned to the screen edge (bottom, left, or right) and consumes screen space. This provides instant access to applications but reduces the usable window area.

## Our Configuration

**Set to**: `false`

**Rationale**: We keep the Dock visible for quick, predictable access to applications. The small screen space trade-off is worth the convenience of always-visible app icons and the download progress indicators.

**Alternative consideration**: If you prefer maximum screen space, set to `true` and use the keyboard shortcut ⌘⌥D to toggle Dock visibility.

## Code Examples

### Read Current Value

```bash
# Check current setting
defaults read com.apple.dock autohide
```

### Enable Auto-Hide

```bash
# Enable Dock auto-hide
defaults write com.apple.dock autohide -bool true

# Restart Dock to apply
killall Dock
```

### Disable Auto-Hide

```bash
# Disable Dock auto-hide (always visible)
defaults write com.apple.dock autohide -bool false

# Restart Dock to apply
killall Dock
```

### Delete (Reset to System Default)

```bash
# Remove custom setting
defaults delete com.apple.dock autohide

# Restart Dock to apply
killall Dock
```

## Related Settings

When `autohide` is enabled, these settings control the animation timing:

### Auto-Hide Delay

```bash
# Time before Dock appears after moving cursor to edge (seconds)
# Default: 0.2
defaults write com.apple.dock autohide-delay -float 0

# Set to 0 for instant appearance
```

### Auto-Hide Time Modifier

```bash
# Speed of the hide/show animation (seconds)
# Default: 0.2
defaults write com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier -float 0.15

# Lower = faster animation
```

## Keyboard Shortcut

Toggle Dock visibility without changing the preference:

**⌘⌥D** (Command + Option + D)

This shortcut works whether auto-hide is enabled or not:
- If auto-hide is **off**: Hides the Dock temporarily
- If auto-hide is **on**: Shows the Dock temporarily

## UI Location

**System Settings** → **Desktop & Dock** → **Automatically hide and show the Dock**

This is a checkbox toggle. When enabled, additional options for mouse position may appear.

## Behavior Details

### When Auto-Hide is Enabled

1. **Hiding**: Dock slides off-screen after ~0.5 seconds of inactivity
2. **Showing**: Move cursor to screen edge, wait for `autohide-delay` duration
3. **Screen edge**: Depends on `orientation` setting (bottom/left/right)
4. **Keyboard access**: ⌃F3 (Control+F3) moves focus to Dock

### Interaction with Full Screen Apps

- In full-screen apps, the Dock always auto-hides regardless of this setting
- Move cursor firmly to the screen edge to reveal the Dock in full-screen mode

### Menu Bar and Dock Together

On laptops with notch displays (14" and 16" MacBook Pro), the menu bar and Dock visibility are independent. You can hide just the Dock while keeping the menu bar visible.

## Compatibility

| macOS Version | Supported |
|---------------|-----------|
| macOS 15 (Sequoia) | ✅ |
| macOS 14 (Sonoma) | ✅ |
| macOS 13 (Ventura) | ✅ |
| macOS 12 (Monterey) | ✅ |
| macOS 11 (Big Sur) | ✅ |
| macOS 10.15 and earlier | ✅ |

This preference has been available since the original macOS Dock.

## Troubleshooting

### Dock Won't Auto-Hide

1. Check the setting is enabled:
   ```bash
   defaults read com.apple.dock autohide
   # Should return 1 or true
   ```

2. Restart the Dock:
   ```bash
   killall Dock
   ```

3. Check for window overlap—some windows may prevent the Dock from hiding

### Dock Slow to Appear

Reduce the show delay:
```bash
defaults write com.apple.dock autohide-delay -float 0
killall Dock
```

### Can't Find Dock After Enabling Auto-Hide

Move your cursor firmly to the bottom (or side) edge of the screen. If using a second monitor, ensure you're at the correct screen edge.
