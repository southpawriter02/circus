# Control Center AirDrop Visibility

Configure where AirDrop controls appear.

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Domain** | `com.apple.controlcenter` |
| **Key** | `AirDrop` |
| **Type** | Integer |
| **Default Value** | `18` |
| **Our Setting** | `18` |

## Description

Controls where the AirDrop toggle appears — in the menu bar, Control Center only, or hidden entirely. AirDrop allows wireless file sharing between Apple devices and needs to be accessible for quick configuration of receiving settings.

## Visibility Values

| Value | Location | Icon Visibility |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| `0` | Disabled | Not shown anywhere |
| `2` | Menu bar | Always visible in menu bar |
| `8` | Menu bar (when active) | Shows only during transfers |
| `18` | Control Center only | Default, access via Control Center |
| `24` | Hidden | Not shown (still functional) |

## Visual Reference

### Menu Bar (value 2):
```
Menu bar: [...] [📡 AirDrop] [🔊] [🔋] [⏰]
                     ↑
              Click to configure
```

### Control Center Only (value 18):
```
Click Control Center → ┌─────────────────────┐
                       │ Wi-Fi      ●        │
                       │ Bluetooth  ●        │
                       │ AirDrop    📡       │ ← Here
                       │ ...                 │
                       └─────────────────────┘
```

## Our Configuration

**Set to**: `18` — Control Center only.

### Why Control Center Only?

1. **Clean menu bar** — Less clutter
2. **Infrequent use** — Not needed constantly
3. **Easy access** — One click to Control Center
4. **Security** — Less obvious to others
5. **Default** — Apple's recommendation

### When to Show in Menu Bar

- Frequently share files via AirDrop
- Quick access to receiving settings
- Team environments with regular sharing

## Code Examples

```bash
# Read current value
defaults read com.apple.controlcenter AirDrop

# Control Center only (default, recommended)
defaults write com.apple.controlcenter AirDrop -int 18

# Always show in menu bar
defaults write com.apple.controlcenter AirDrop -int 2

# Show only when active
defaults write com.apple.controlcenter AirDrop -int 8

# Hide completely
defaults write com.apple.controlcenter AirDrop -int 24

# Delete (reset to default)
defaults delete com.apple.controlcenter AirDrop
```

## UI Location

**System Settings** → **Control Center** → **AirDrop**

Options:
- Show in Menu Bar
- Don't Show in Menu Bar (Control Center access remains)

## AirDrop Receiving Settings

Regardless of visibility, AirDrop has three modes:

| Mode | Receives From |
|------|---------------|
| Receiving Off | Nobody |
| Contacts Only | People in your Contacts |
| Everyone | Any nearby Apple device |

⚠️ **Security**: Use "Contacts Only" or "Off" in public places.

## Changing AirDrop Mode

Via Control Center:
1. Open Control Center
2. Click AirDrop
3. Select receiving mode

Via Finder:
1. Open Finder
2. Go → AirDrop (⇧⌘R)
3. Click "Allow me to be discovered by"

## AirDrop Requirements

For AirDrop to work:
- Wi-Fi enabled (doesn't need network)
- Bluetooth enabled
- Devices within ~30 feet
- Both devices unlocked

## Security Considerations

In public:
```
Risk: "Everyone" mode → Strangers can send files
      └── May receive unwanted images/files

Safe: "Contacts Only" → Only known people
      └── Requires both parties in each other's Contacts
```

## Related Settings

```bash
# Bluetooth (required for AirDrop)
defaults write com.apple.controlcenter Bluetooth -int 2

# Wi-Fi (required for AirDrop)
defaults write com.apple.controlcenter WiFi -int 2
```

## AirDrop Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Not seeing devices | Check Bluetooth and Wi-Fi on |
| Can't receive | Check receiving mode |
| Firewall blocking | Allow incoming in Firewall options |
| Old device | Check device compatibility |
