# FocusFollowsMouse

Control whether Terminal windows auto-focus on mouse hover.

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Domain** | `com.apple.Terminal` |
| **Key** | `FocusFollowsMouse` |
| **Type** | Boolean |
| **Default Value** | `false` |
| **Our Setting** | `false` |

## Description

Controls whether Terminal windows automatically receive keyboard focus when the mouse cursor hovers over them, without requiring a click. This is a Unix/X11-style window management behavior.

## Values

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `true` | **Focus follows mouse** — Window under cursor is active |
| `false` | **Click to focus** (default) — Standard macOS behavior |

## Our Configuration

**Set to**: `false` — Maintain standard macOS click-to-focus behavior.

### Why Keep Default?

1. **Consistency** — Matches rest of macOS
2. **Predictability** — Windows don't change unexpectedly
3. **Typing safety** — Won't accidentally type in wrong window
4. **Multi-monitor** — Less confusing with multiple displays

### When to Enable

Some power users prefer focus-follows-mouse when:
- Coming from Linux/X11 environments
- Managing many terminal windows simultaneously
- Using tiling window managers (like yabai)

## Code Examples

```bash
# Read current value
defaults read com.apple.Terminal FocusFollowsMouse

# Standard macOS behavior (click to focus)
defaults write com.apple.Terminal FocusFollowsMouse -bool false

# X11-style focus follows mouse
defaults write com.apple.Terminal FocusFollowsMouse -bool true

# Delete (reset to default)
defaults delete com.apple.Terminal FocusFollowsMouse
```

## UI Location

Not exposed in UI — terminal-only setting.

## How It Works When Enabled

1. Move mouse over Terminal window A → A becomes active
2. Type → Keystrokes go to window A
3. Move mouse to Terminal window B → B becomes active
4. Type → Keystrokes now go to window B
5. **No clicking required**

### Gotchas When Enabled

- **Accidental input**: Moving mouse while typing can send keys to wrong window
- **Dialog confusion**: Moving past dialogs can dismiss them
- **Menu bar**: Moving to menu bar might change focus unexpectedly

## Alternative: Raise on Click Only

For a middle ground, you might want:
- Click to focus AND raise window (standard)
- Or: Focus follows mouse but don't raise window

macOS doesn't have a native "focus without raise" option like X11.

## Related Settings

```bash
# Other Terminal window behaviors
defaults write com.apple.Terminal NewTabWorkingDirectoryBehavior -int 2
defaults write com.apple.Terminal SecureKeyboardEntry -bool true
```

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Focus not following mouse | Restart Terminal after setting |
| Other apps affected | This only affects Terminal.app |
| Accidentally typing in wrong window | Disable setting; use click-to-focus |

## Compatibility

- **Terminal**: macOS 10.6+
- **Note**: This ONLY affects Terminal.app, not other applications

## Source File

**File**: [`defaults/applications/terminal.sh`](../../../../defaults/applications/terminal.sh)

```bash
run_defaults "com.apple.Terminal" "FocusFollowsMouse" "-bool" "false"
```
