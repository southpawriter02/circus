# Preview Anti-Aliasing

Enable smooth image rendering when zoomed.

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Domain** | `com.apple.Preview` |
| **Key** | `PVAntiAliasImages` |
| **Type** | Boolean |
| **Default Value** | `true` |
| **Our Setting** | `true` |

## Description

Controls whether Preview applies anti-aliasing (smoothing) to images, particularly when zoomed out. Anti-aliasing smooths jagged edges but may slightly soften pixel-perfect artwork.

## Values

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `true` | **Smooth edges** (default) — Anti-aliased rendering |
| `false` | **Sharp pixels** — No smoothing, exact pixel display |

## Visual Difference

**With Anti-Aliasing (`true`):**
```
Diagonal lines appear smooth
Curved edges are clean
Zoomed-out images look natural
```

**Without Anti-Aliasing (`false`):**
```
Diagonal lines show stair-stepping
Edges appear jagged
Pixels are crisp and exact
```

## Our Configuration

**Set to**: `true` — Smooth, natural-looking images.

### When to Disable

You might want anti-aliasing OFF for:
- **Pixel art** — Viewing retro game graphics
- **Icon design** — Need exact pixel placement
- **Image inspection** — Verifying individual pixels
- **Screenshots** — Checking exact rendering

## Code Examples

```bash
# Enable anti-aliasing (smooth rendering)
defaults write com.apple.Preview PVAntiAliasImages -bool true

# Disable anti-aliasing (sharp pixels)
defaults write com.apple.Preview PVAntiAliasImages -bool false
```

## UI Location

Not exposed in UI — terminal only.

## How Anti-Aliasing Works

When an image is displayed smaller than its native resolution, the system must decide how to combine multiple source pixels into fewer display pixels:

**Without AA**: Nearest neighbor sampling (one pixel represents area)
**With AA**: Weighted average of surrounding pixels (smoother result)

## Zoom-Level Dependent

Anti-aliasing is most noticeable when:
- Viewing large images fitted to window
- Zoomed out below 100%
- Diagonal lines or curves present

At 100% zoom (actual size), there's no difference.

## Related Settings

```bash
# Complete image viewing setup
defaults write com.apple.Preview PVAntiAliasImages -bool true
defaults write com.apple.Preview PVScaleDocumentsToFit -bool true
defaults write com.apple.Preview PVBackgroundColor -int 0
```

## Compatibility

- **Preview**: All macOS versions
- **Affects**: All image formats

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Images still blurry | Set to true and restart Preview |
| Pixel art looks wrong | Set to false for exact pixels |
| Only visible zoomed out | Expected at 100% zoom, no difference |
