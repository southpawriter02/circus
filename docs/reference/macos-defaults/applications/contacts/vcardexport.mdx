# Contacts vCard Export Settings

Control what information is included when exporting vCards.

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Domain** | `com.apple.AddressBook` |
| **Keys** | `ABIncludePhotosInVCards`, `ABIncludeNotesInVCard` |
| **Type** | Boolean |
| **Default Value** | `true`, `true` |
| **Our Setting** | `true`, `false` |

## Description

Controls what data is included when exporting contacts as vCard files. vCards (.vcf) are the standard format for sharing contact information. These settings let you control privacy by omitting photos or notes.

## Key Settings

| Key | Purpose | Our Setting |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `ABIncludePhotosInVCards` | Include contact photos | `true` |
| `ABIncludeNotesInVCard` | Include notes field | `false` |

## Our Configuration

- **Photos**: `true` — Include photos for recognition
- **Notes**: `false` — Exclude notes for privacy

### Why Exclude Notes?

Notes often contain:
- Personal reminders about people
- Private information
- Context you wouldn't share
- Sensitive details

Excluding notes prevents accidentally sharing private information.

## Code Examples

```bash
# Read current values
defaults read com.apple.AddressBook ABIncludePhotosInVCards
defaults read com.apple.AddressBook ABIncludeNotesInVCard

# Include photos in vCards
defaults write com.apple.AddressBook ABIncludePhotosInVCards -bool true

# Exclude notes from vCards (privacy)
defaults write com.apple.AddressBook ABIncludeNotesInVCard -bool false

# Reset to defaults
defaults delete com.apple.AddressBook ABIncludePhotosInVCards
defaults delete com.apple.AddressBook ABIncludeNotesInVCard
```

## UI Location

**Contacts** → **Settings** (⌘,) → **vCard**

Options:
- Export photos in vCards
- Export notes in vCards
- vCard Format (2.1 vs 3.0)

## vCard Format

# Use legacy vCard 2.1 format (older device compatibility)

```
