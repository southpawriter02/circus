# Music Sound Check (Volume Normalization)

Automatically adjust playback volume for consistent listening.

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Domain** | `com.apple.Music` |
| **Key** | `normalizeVolume` |
| **Type** | Boolean |
| **Default Value** | `false` |
| **Our Setting** | `true` |

## Description

Sound Check analyzes your music library and automatically adjusts playback volume so all songs play at a similar loudness level. This prevents jarring volume changes between quiet acoustic tracks and loud rock songs.

## Values

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `true` | **Normalize volume** — Consistent loudness across songs |
| `false` | **Original volume** (default) — Play at recorded levels |

## The Problem It Solves

Without Sound Check:
```
🎵 Quiet jazz song → 🔊 Comfortable volume
🎵 Loud rock song → 📢 BLASTING! (scramble for volume)
🎵 Classical piece → 🔇 Can barely hear (turn it up)
🎵 Pop song → 📢 WAY TOO LOUD (turn it down)
```

With Sound Check:
```
🎵 All songs → 🔊 Consistent comfortable volume
```

## Our Configuration

**Set to**: `true` — Consistent listening experience.

### How It Works

1. Music analyzes each track's loudness (ReplayGain-style)
2. Stores normalization data in the library
3. Applies gain adjustment during playback
4. Does NOT modify the actual audio files

## Code Examples

```bash
# Read current value
defaults read com.apple.Music normalizeVolume

# Enable Sound Check
defaults write com.apple.Music normalizeVolume -bool true

# Disable Sound Check (original levels)
defaults write com.apple.Music normalizeVolume -bool false

# Delete (reset to default)
defaults delete com.apple.Music normalizeVolume

# Restart Music to apply
killall Music
```

## UI Location

**Music** → **Settings** (⌘,) → **Playback** → **Sound Check**

## When to Disable

You might prefer Sound Check disabled if:
- You're an audiophile wanting original mastering
- Playing DJ sets where volume variation is intentional
- Listening to albums where dynamics are important
- You want maximum volume from all tracks

## Related Settings

```bash
# Disable sound "enhancement" (keeps pure audio)
defaults write com.apple.Music soundEnhancerEnabled -bool false

# Disable crossfade (clean transitions)
defaults write com.apple.Music crossfadeEnabled -bool false
```

## Compatibility

- **Music app**: macOS 10.15 (Catalina) and later
- **iTunes**: Similar setting available
- **Syncs**: Setting does NOT sync to iPhone, set separately

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Some songs still loud | Library may need re-analysis |
| Normalization too aggressive | Disable for critical listening |
| Takes effect slowly | Analysis happens in background |

## Source File

**File**: [`defaults/applications/music.sh`](../../../../defaults/applications/music.sh)

```bash
run_defaults "com.apple.Music" "normalizeVolume" "-bool" "true"
```
