# Music Notifications

Control whether Music shows notifications when tracks change.

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Domain** | `com.apple.Music` |
| **Key** | `userWantsNotifications` |
| **Type** | Boolean |
| **Default Value** | `true` |
| **Our Setting** | `false` |

## Description

Controls whether the Music app shows macOS notifications when the currently playing song changes. Each track change triggers a banner notification showing the song name, artist, and album art.

## Values

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `true` | **Show notifications** (default) — Banner on each song |
| `false` | **No notifications** — Silent track changes |

## The Notification

When enabled, each song shows:

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ 🎵 Now Playing              │
│ Song Title                  │
│ Artist Name - Album Name    │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

## Our Configuration

**Set to**: `false` — Reduce notification noise.

### Why Disable?

1. **Notification overload** — Every 3-4 minutes during playback
2. **Focus interruption** — Banners distract from work
3. **Already visible** — Music widget/player shows current song
4. **Known music** — You likely know what playlist you're playing

### When to Enable

- Discovering new music (radio, curated playlists)
- Shuffled playlists where you want to know song names
- Apple Music Radio listening

## Code Examples

```bash
# Disable song change notifications (recommended)
defaults write com.apple.Music userWantsNotifications -bool false

# Enable song change notifications
defaults write com.apple.Music userWantsNotifications -bool true

# Restart Music
killall Music
```

## UI Location

**Music** → **Settings** (⌘,) → **General** → **Notifications**

## Alternative: Now Playing Widget

1. Click Notification Center icon (top-right of menu bar)
2. Edit Widgets
3. Add "Now Playing" widget
4. Always visible without notifications

## Control Center Now Playing

Also available in Control Center:

```
