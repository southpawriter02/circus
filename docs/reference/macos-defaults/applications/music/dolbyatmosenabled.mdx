3. **Built-in speakers** on Mac (limited effect)
4. **Atmos-enabled tracks** (not all music)

| AirPods (3rd gen) | Supported |

## Code Examples

```bash
# Read current value
defaults read com.apple.Music dolbyAtmosEnabled

# Enable Dolby Atmos
defaults write com.apple.Music dolbyAtmosEnabled -bool true

# Disable (stereo only)
defaults write com.apple.Music dolbyAtmosEnabled -bool false

# Delete (reset to default)
defaults delete com.apple.Music dolbyAtmosEnabled

# Restart Music to apply
killall Music
```

## UI Location

**Music** → **Settings** (⌘,) → **Playback** → **Dolby Atmos**

Options:
- Automatic (Atmos when available)
- Always On
- Off

## Finding Atmos Content

In Apple Music:
1. Look for "Dolby Atmos" badge on albums
2. Browse: **Music** → **Browse** → **Spatial Audio**
3. Albums have "Dolby Atmos" in description

## Audiophile Note

Some purists prefer stereo masters:
- Original artist intent was stereo
- Atmos mix may differ from stereo mix
- Personal preference matters

You can disable per-session in the playback controls.

## Complete Audio Setup

```bash
# Full quality audio experience
defaults write com.apple.Music dolbyAtmosEnabled -bool true
defaults write com.apple.Music losslessEnabled -bool true
defaults write com.apple.Music normalizeVolume -bool true
defaults write com.apple.Music soundEnhancerEnabled -bool false
```

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| No spatial effect heard | Use AirPods Pro/Max; check head tracking |
| Atmos not available for song | Not all tracks have Atmos mixes |
| Sound seems different | Atmos mixes differ from stereo; intentional |
