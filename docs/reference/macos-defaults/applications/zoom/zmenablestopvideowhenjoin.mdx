# Zoom Video When Joining

Control whether camera is on or off when joining meetings.

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Domain** | `us.zoom.xos` |
| **Key** | `ZMEnableStopVideoWhenJoin` |
| **Type** | Boolean |
| **Default Value** | `false` |
| **Our Setting** | `true` |

## Description

Controls whether your camera is automatically enabled when joining a Zoom meeting. When enabled (set to `true`), you join with video OFF, giving you time to prepare before being seen.

## Values

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `true` | **Join with video OFF** — Camera disabled until you turn it on |
| `false` | **Join with video ON** (default) — Camera activates immediately |

## Our Configuration

**Set to**: `true` — Join meetings with camera off by default.

### Why Join with Video Off?

1. **Preparation time** — Check appearance before being seen
2. **Privacy** — Control when others see you
3. **Bandwidth saving** — Video uses significant data
4. **Comfort** — Turn on when ready, not when rushed
5. **Background check** — Ensure nothing embarrassing visible

### Professional Considerations

- **Expected video**: Some meetings expect video on
- **Quick toggle**: ⌘⇧V turns video on quickly
- **Preview**: You can preview video before turning on

## Code Examples

```bash
# Join with video OFF (recommended)
defaults write us.zoom.xos ZMEnableStopVideoWhenJoin -bool true

# Join with video ON (Zoom default)
defaults write us.zoom.xos ZMEnableStopVideoWhenJoin -bool false

# Restart Zoom
killall zoom.us
```

## UI Location

**Zoom** → **Settings** (⌘,) → **Video** → ☑ **Turn off my video when joining a meeting**

## Quick Video Toggle

During a meeting:
- **⌘⇧V** — Toggle video on/off
- Click camera icon in meeting controls
- Space bar — Temporary video on (release to turn off)

## Related Audio Setting

Also start with microphone muted:

```bash
# Join with microphone muted
defaults write us.zoom.xos ZMEnableMuteWhenJoin -bool true
```

## Complete "Quiet Join" Setup

```bash
# Enter meetings quietly
defaults write us.zoom.xos ZMEnableStopVideoWhenJoin -bool true
defaults write us.zoom.xos ZMEnableMuteWhenJoin -bool true
defaults write us.zoom.xos ZMEnableAutoJoinVoip -bool true
```

This setting:
- Video OFF
- Microphone MUTED
- Audio automatically connected (no prompt)
