# Books Audiobook Skip Intervals

Set how many seconds to skip forward and back during audiobook playback.

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Domain** | `com.apple.iBooksX` |
| **Keys** | `BKAudiobookSkipForward`, `BKAudiobookSkipBack` |
| **Type** | Integer |
| **Default Value** | `15` (both) |
| **Our Setting** | `15` (both) |

## Description

Controls the duration of skip forward and skip back actions during audiobook playback in Apple Books. Unlike podcasts, audiobooks typically use symmetric skip intervals since you're more likely to replay content you missed.

## Values

| Setting | Options |
|---------|---------|
| Skip Forward | 15, 30, 45, 60 seconds |
| Skip Back | 15, 30, 45, 60 seconds |

## Our Configuration

**Forward**: `15` seconds
**Back**: `15` seconds

### Why Symmetric?

Unlike podcasts (which have ads to skip), audiobooks benefit from:
- Equal forward/back for navigation
- Shorter skips for precise positioning
- Replay segments for comprehension

## Code Examples

```bash
# Standard intervals (recommended)
defaults write com.apple.iBooksX BKAudiobookSkipForward -int 15
defaults write com.apple.iBooksX BKAudiobookSkipBack -int 15

# Larger jumps for quick navigation
defaults write com.apple.iBooksX BKAudiobookSkipForward -int 30
defaults write com.apple.iBooksX BKAudiobookSkipBack -int 30
```

## UI Location

Controls appear during audiobook playback. Settings may be accessible during playback.
