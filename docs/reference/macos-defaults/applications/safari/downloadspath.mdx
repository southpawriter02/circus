# Safari Downloads Path

Configure where Safari saves downloaded files.

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Domain** | `com.apple.Safari` |
| **Key** | `DownloadsPath` |
| **Type** | String |
| **Default Value** | `~/Downloads` |
| **Our Setting** | `~/Downloads` |

## Description

Specifies the default folder where Safari saves downloaded files. You can set this to any accessible directory, or configure Safari to ask for each download location.

## Values

| Value | Download Location |
|-------|-------------------|
| `~/Downloads` | User's Downloads folder (default) |
| `~/Desktop` | Save directly to Desktop |
| Custom path | Any accessible directory |

## Our Configuration

**Set to**: `~/Downloads` — Standard Downloads folder.

### Why Downloads Folder?

1. **Standard location** — Expected by other apps
2. **Easy access** — In Finder sidebar
3. **Stack support** — Downloads stack in Dock
4. **Cleanup** — Easy to manage
5. **Organized** — Keeps Desktop clean

### Alternative Locations

- `~/Desktop` — Immediate visibility
- `~/Documents/Downloads` — More organized
- External drive — Large files
- Project folder — Context-specific

## Code Examples

```bash
# Read current value
defaults read com.apple.Safari DownloadsPath

# Set to default Downloads folder
defaults write com.apple.Safari DownloadsPath -string "~/Downloads"

# Set to Desktop
defaults write com.apple.Safari DownloadsPath -string "~/Desktop"

# Set to custom location
defaults write com.apple.Safari DownloadsPath -string "~/Documents/Safari Downloads"

# Delete (reset to default)
defaults delete com.apple.Safari DownloadsPath
```

## UI Location

**Safari** → **Settings** (⌘,) → **General** → **File download location**

Options:

## Ask for Each Download

For maximum control:
1. Open Safari Settings
2. Go to General
3. Set download location to "Ask for each download"
4. Choose location for every file

## Downloads Folder Stack

With default location, enable stack:
1. Right-click Dock near Trash

## Automatic Download Organization

macOS Smart Folders can auto-organize:

Or use Hazel / third-party automation.

## Opening Downloaded Files

Downloaded files are quarantined:

```

## Per-Site Download Locations

Safari can remember locations per-website:
1. Download from site
2. Choose "Other..."
3. Navigate to preferred location
4. Future downloads go there

## Download Notification

Safari shows download progress:
- Activity window
- Downloads button in toolbar
- Notification when complete

## Troubleshooting
