# Calendar Work Hours

Set the start and end times for work hours in Calendar views.

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Domain** | `com.apple.iCal` |
| **Keys** | `first minute of work hours`, `last minute of work hours` |
| **Type** | Integer |
| **Default Value** | `480` (8 AM), `1020` (5 PM) |
| **Our Setting** | `540` (9 AM), `1080` (6 PM) |

## Description

Controls the work hours displayed prominently in Calendar's day and week views. Hours outside work hours appear compressed, while work hours are expanded for easier scheduling.

## Values

Values are in minutes from midnight:

| Minutes | Time |
|---------|------|
| `360` | 6:00 AM |
| `420` | 7:00 AM |
| `480` | 8:00 AM |
| `540` | 9:00 AM |
| `600` | 10:00 AM |
| `1020` | 5:00 PM |
| `1080` | 6:00 PM |
| `1140` | 7:00 PM |

**Formula**: `hours × 60 = minutes`

## Our Configuration

- **Start**: `540` (9:00 AM)
- **End**: `1080` (6:00 PM)

### Why 9 AM - 6 PM?

1. **Modern work** — Later start times are common
2. **Flexibility** — Room for early/late meetings
3. **Focus** — Core hours prominently displayed

## Code Examples

```bash
# Read current values
defaults read com.apple.iCal "first minute of work hours"
defaults read com.apple.iCal "last minute of work hours"

# Set work hours 9 AM - 6 PM
defaults write com.apple.iCal "first minute of work hours" -int 540
defaults write com.apple.iCal "last minute of work hours" -int 1080

# Set traditional 8 AM - 5 PM
defaults write com.apple.iCal "first minute of work hours" -int 480
defaults write com.apple.iCal "last minute of work hours" -int 1020

# Delete (reset to defaults)
defaults delete com.apple.iCal "first minute of work hours"
defaults delete com.apple.iCal "last minute of work hours"
```
