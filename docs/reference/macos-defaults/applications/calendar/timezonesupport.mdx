# Calendar Time Zone Support

Enable time zone awareness for events.

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Domain** | `com.apple.iCal` |
| **Key** | `TimeZone support enabled` |
| **Type** | Boolean |
| **Default Value** | `false` |
| **Our Setting** | `true` |

## Description

Enables the ability to set specific time zones for events, independent of your current location. Essential for scheduling across time zones in remote work scenarios.

## Values

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `true` | **Time zone aware** — Events have explicit time zones |
| `false` | **Local time only** (default) — All times in current zone |

## Why This Matters

### Without Time Zone Support

You're in New York creating an event:
```
Meeting at 3:00 PM
```
You travel to Los Angeles, calendar shows:
```
Meeting at 3:00 PM  (but it's really 12:00 PM LA time!)
```

### With Time Zone Support

You're in New York creating an event:
```
Meeting at 3:00 PM EST
```
You travel to Los Angeles, calendar shows:
```
Meeting at 12:00 PM PST (correctly converted)
```

## Our Configuration

**Set to**: `true` — Essential for remote work and travel.

### Benefits

1. **Travel-proof scheduling** — Events stay correct when you move
2. **Remote team coordination** — Schedule for others' time zones
3. **International meetings** — Clear timezone specification
4. **No confusion** — Explicit timezone removes ambiguity

## Code Examples

```bash
# Read current value
defaults read com.apple.iCal "TimeZone support enabled"

# Enable time zone support
defaults write com.apple.iCal "TimeZone support enabled" -bool true

# Disable time zone support
defaults write com.apple.iCal "TimeZone support enabled" -bool false

# Delete (reset to default)
defaults delete com.apple.iCal "TimeZone support enabled"

# Restart Calendar to apply
killall Calendar
```

## UI Location

**Calendar** → **Settings** (⌘,) → **Advanced** → **Turn on time zone support**

Once enabled, you'll see:
- Time zone dropdown in event editor
- Time zone selector in Calendar window

## Using Time Zones

After enabling:
1. Create or edit an event
2. Click the time zone next to the time
3. Select the appropriate zone
4. Event will adjust when you travel

## Related Settings

```bash
# Week starts on Monday (ISO 8601)
defaults write com.apple.iCal "first day of week" -int 1

# Show week numbers
defaults write com.apple.iCal "Show Week Numbers" -bool true
```

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Time zone dropdown not visible | Restart Calendar after enabling |
| Events at wrong time after travel | Ensure events have explicit timezone set |
| External calendars not converting | Check calendar service supports timezone |
