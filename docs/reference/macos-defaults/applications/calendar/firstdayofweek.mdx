## Visual Difference

**Sunday Start (0):**
```

 1    2    3    4    5    6    7
```

**Monday Start (1):**
```
Mon  Tue  Wed  Thu  Fri  Sat  Sun

```

## Code Examples

```bash
# Read current value
defaults read com.apple.iCal "first day of week"

# Set Monday as first day (ISO 8601)
defaults write com.apple.iCal "first day of week" -int 1

# Set Sunday as first day (US default)
defaults write com.apple.iCal "first day of week" -int 0

# Delete (reset to default)
defaults delete com.apple.iCal "first day of week"

# Restart Calendar to apply
killall Calendar
```

## UI Location

**Calendar** → **Settings** (⌘,) → **General** → **Start week on**

## Why Monday?

1. **ISO 8601 compliance** — International date standard
2. **Work week logic** — Mon-Fri naturally grouped
3. **Weekend together** — Sat-Sun at week's end
4. **International consistency** — Matches most countries

## Related Settings

```bash
# Show week numbers
defaults write com.apple.iCal "Show Week Numbers" -bool true

# Scroll by week in week view
defaults write com.apple.iCal "scroll by weeks in week view" -bool true
```

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Week still starts on Sunday | Restart Calendar: `killall Calendar` |
