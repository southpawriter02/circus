| **Type** | Boolean |
| **Default Value** | `false` |

## Description

Shows ISO 8601 week numbers in the calendar sidebar and week view. Week numbers (W1-W52) provide a standardized way to reference specific weeks of the year.

## Values

| `true` | **Show week numbers** — W1, W2, W3... visible |
| `false` | **Hide week numbers** (default) — Dates only |

## Visual Example

**Month View with Week Numbers:**
```
January 2026
W1  Mon  Tue  Wed  Thu  Fri  Sat  Sun
         1    2    
W2   5    6    7    8    9   10   11
W3  12   13   14   15   16   17   18
W4  19   20   21   22   23   24   25
W5  26   27   28   29   30   31
```

## Our Configuration

**Set to**: `true` — Show week numbers for planning.

### Use Cases

1. **Project planning** — "Deadline is W12"
2. **Sprint tracking** — "Sprint 5 = W10-W11"
3. **Business scheduling** — Common in Europe
4. **International coordination** — ISO 8601 standard

## Code Examples

```bash
# Read current value
defaults read com.apple.iCal "Show Week Numbers"

# Show week numbers
defaults write com.apple.iCal "Show Week Numbers" -bool true

# Hide week numbers
defaults write com.apple.iCal "Show Week Numbers" -bool false

# Delete (reset to default)
defaults delete com.apple.iCal "Show Week Numbers"

# Restart Calendar to apply
killall Calendar
```

## UI Location

**Calendar** → **Settings** (⌘,) → **Advanced** → **Show week numbers**

## ISO 8601 Week Rules

The ISO standard defines:
- Week 1 contains January 4th (first week with majority of days in new year)
- Weeks start on Monday
- Year has 52 or 53 weeks

### Edge Cases

| Date | Week | Note |
|------|------|------|
| Jan 1, 2026 | W1 | First week |
| Dec 31, 2026 | W53 | Some years have W53 |
| Jan 1, 2025 | W1 2025 | Could be labeled previous year's week |

## Related Settings

```bash
# Start week on Monday (required for ISO weeks)
defaults write com.apple.iCal "first day of week" -int 1

# Enable time zone support
defaults write com.apple.iCal "TimeZone support enabled" -bool true
```

## Complete ISO-Compliant Setup

```bash
# ISO 8601 compliant calendar
defaults write com.apple.iCal "first day of week" -int 1
defaults write com.apple.iCal "Show Week Numbers" -bool true
```

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Week numbers not showing | Restart Calendar: `killall Calendar` |
| Wrong week numbers | Check "first day of week" is set to Monday (1) |
| W1 starts mid-January | ISO 8601 defines W1 as week containing Jan 4 |
