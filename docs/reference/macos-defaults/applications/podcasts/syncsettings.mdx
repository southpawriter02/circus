### The Magic

```
iPhone at gym:
Play episode, pause at 15:32
    ↓
iCloud sync
    ↓
Mac at desk:
Resume from 15:32
```

## Code Examples

```bash
# Enable full sync (recommended)
defaults write com.apple.podcasts syncPodcasts -bool true
defaults write com.apple.podcasts syncListeningHistory -bool true

# Disable sync (local only)
defaults write com.apple.podcasts syncPodcasts -bool false
defaults write com.apple.podcasts syncListeningHistory -bool false
```

## UI Location

**Podcasts** → **Settings** (⌘,) → **General** → ☑ **Sync Podcasts**

### iCloud Settings

Also ensure Podcasts is enabled in iCloud:
**System Settings** → **Apple ID** → **iCloud** → **Show All** → ☑ **Podcasts**

## Troubleshooting Sync

If sync isn't working:
1. Check same Apple ID on all devices
2. Verify iCloud → Podcasts is enabled
3. Check internet connection
4. Force quit and reopen Podcasts
5. Wait — sync can take a few minutes

## Storage Considerations

Sync shares metadata, not downloads:
- Subscriptions sync (small data)
- Progress syncs (tiny data)
- Downloaded episodes do NOT sync (large files)
- Each device downloads its own copies

## Compatibility

- **Podcasts**: macOS 10.15+
- **iOS**: Podcasts app
- **Requires**: iCloud account

## Source File

**File**: [`defaults/applications/podcasts.sh`](../../../../defaults/applications/podcasts.sh)

```bash
run_defaults "com.apple.podcasts" "syncPodcasts" "-bool" "true"
run_defaults "com.apple.podcasts" "syncListeningHistory" "-bool" "true"
```
