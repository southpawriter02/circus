Control automatic downloading and removal of episodes.

## Overview

|----------|-------|
| **Domain** | `com.apple.podcasts` |
| **Keys** | `downloadNewEpisodes`, `removePlayedEpisodes`, `episodeLimit` |
| **Type** | Boolean, Boolean, Integer |
| **Default Value** | `true`, `true`, `0` |
| **Our Setting** | `true`, `true`, `10` |

## Description

These settings control how Podcasts manages episode downloads and storage, balancing offline availability with storage space management.

## The Three Episode Settings

| Key | Purpose | Our Setting |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `downloadNewEpisodes` | Auto-download new episodes | `true` |
| `removePlayedEpisodes` | Delete after playing | `true` |
| `episodeLimit` | Max episodes to keep | `10` |

## Episode Limit Values

| Value | Keeps |
|-------|-------|
| `0` | All episodes (no limit) |
| `1` | Most recent only |
| `3` | Last 3 episodes |
| `5` | Last 5 episodes |
| `10` | Last 10 episodes (recommended) |

## Our Configuration

- **Auto-download**: `true` — Offline listening available
- **Remove played**: `true` — Recover storage space
- **Limit**: `10` — Balance availability and storage

### Workflow

```
New episode released
    ↓
Auto-downloaded
    ↓

    ↓

    ↓
Automatically deleted
```

## Code Examples

```bash
# Balanced storage management
defaults write com.apple.podcasts downloadNewEpisodes -bool true
defaults write com.apple.podcasts removePlayedEpisodes -bool true
defaults write com.apple.podcasts episodeLimit -int 10

# Minimal storage usage
defaults write com.apple.podcasts downloadNewEpisodes -bool false
defaults write com.apple.podcasts removePlayedEpisodes -bool true
defaults write com.apple.podcasts episodeLimit -int 1

# Archive everything
defaults write com.apple.podcasts downloadNewEpisodes -bool true
defaults write com.apple.podcasts removePlayedEpisodes -bool false
defaults write com.apple.podcasts episodeLimit -int 0
```

## UI Location

**Podcasts** → **Settings** (⌘,) → **General**

- Download Episodes: [On/Off]
- Remove Played Downloads: [On/Off]
- Limit Episodes: [dropdown]

## Per-Show Override

You can configure individual shows differently:
1. Right-click a podcast in your library
2. Select **Settings**
3. Override download and episode limit settings

## Storage Considerations

| Subscription Count | Avg Episode Size | 10 eps/show |
|-------------------|------------------|-------------|
| 5 shows | 50 MB | ~2.5 GB |
| 10 shows | 50 MB | ~5 GB |
| 20 shows | 50 MB | ~10 GB |

## Compatibility

- **Podcasts**: macOS 10.15+
- **Syncs**: Download settings sync via iCloud

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Too much storage | Reduce episode limit |
| Episodes not downloading | Check network connection |
| Old episodes persisting | Check per-show override settings |
