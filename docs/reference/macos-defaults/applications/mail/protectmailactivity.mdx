# Mail Privacy Protection

Hide your IP address and block email tracking.

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Domain** | `com.apple.mail` |
| **Key** | `ProtectMailActivityInICloud` |
| **Type** | Boolean |
| **Default Value** | `true` (since macOS Monterey) |
| **Our Setting** | `true` |

## Description

Mail Privacy Protection is Apple's comprehensive email privacy feature that:
1. **Hides your IP address** from email senders
2. **Loads remote content privately** through Apple's proxy servers
3. **Prevents read receipts** by masking when/if you opened an email

This defeats email tracking pixels and prevents senders from building a profile of your email behavior.

## How It Works

### Traditional Email Tracking

Without protection:
1. Marketing email contains invisible 1x1 pixel image
2. When you open email, your device fetches the image
3. Sender logs your IP, time, location, device type
4. They know you opened the email and where you are

### With Mail Privacy Protection

1. Apple's servers pre-fetch all remote content
2. Your Mail app loads content from Apple's cache
3. Sender sees Apple's IP address, not yours
4. Open time is randomized/hidden

## Values

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `true` | **Protected** (default) — IP hidden, private loading |
| `false` | **Unprotected** — Senders can track you |

## Our Configuration

**Set to**: `true` — Maximum email privacy.

## Code Examples

```bash
# Enable Mail Privacy Protection (should be default)
defaults write com.apple.mail ProtectMailActivityInICloud -bool true

# Check current setting
defaults read com.apple.mail ProtectMailActivityInICloud
```

## UI Location

**Mail** → **Settings** (⌘,) → **Privacy** → **Protect Mail Activity**

When enabled, you'll see:
- ☑ Hide IP Address
- ☑ Block All Remote Content (optional, more aggressive)

## Additional Privacy: Block All Remote Content

For maximum privacy, also block remote content entirely:

```bash
# Block ALL remote images/content
defaults write com.apple.mail DisableURLLoading -bool true
```

| Setting | Privacy | Experience |
|---------|---------|------------|
| Protect Mail Activity only | High | Images load normally |
| + Block All Remote Content | Maximum | Must click to load images |

## What Senders See

| Data Point | Without Protection | With Protection |
|------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| IP Address | Your real IP | Apple's servers |
| Location | Your city/region | Unknown |
| Device type | iPhone/Mac/etc | Hidden |
| Open time | Exact timestamp | Randomized/hidden |
| Open count | Accurate | Unreliable |

## Compatibility

- **macOS**: 12.0 (Monterey) and later
- **iOS**: 15.0 and later
- **Requirements**: Works with any email account in Mail.app

## Limitations

1. **Only in Mail.app** — Other email clients don't have this protection
2. **Pre-fetching uses data** — All remote content is downloaded, even if you never open the email
3. **Link tracking still works** — Clicking links in emails can still be tracked

## Related Settings

```bash
# Block remote content entirely (more aggressive)
defaults write com.apple.mail DisableURLLoading -bool true

# Enable conversation view
defaults write com.apple.mail ConversationViewEnabled -bool true
```
