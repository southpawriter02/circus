# Notes Sort Order

Control how notes are sorted in the list.

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Domain** | `com.apple.Notes` |
| **Key** | `NotesSortOrder` |
| **Type** | Integer |
| **Default Value** | `1` |
| **Our Setting** | `1` |

## Description

Determines how notes are ordered in the notes list. Sorting by date edited keeps your most recently worked-on notes at the top.

## Values

| Value | Sort By | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `1` | **Date Edited** (default) | Most recently modified first |
| `2` | **Date Created** | Newest created first |
| `3` | **Title** | Alphabetical by title |

## Our Configuration

**Set to**: `1` — Sort by date edited (most recent on top).

### Why Date Edited?

1. **Active notes surface** — Currently working notes at top
2. **Natural workflow** — Recently used = probably needed again
3. **Auto-organization** — No manual sorting needed
4. **Quick access** — Find recent work immediately

### When to Use Other Options

- **Date Created**: Chronological journaling, meeting notes
- **Title**: Reference notes you locate by name

## Code Examples

```bash
# Read current value
defaults read com.apple.Notes NotesSortOrder

# Sort by date edited (default, recommended)
defaults write com.apple.Notes NotesSortOrder -int 1

# Sort by date created
defaults write com.apple.Notes NotesSortOrder -int 2

# Sort by title (A-Z)
defaults write com.apple.Notes NotesSortOrder -int 3

# Delete (reset to default)
defaults delete com.apple.Notes NotesSortOrder
```

## UI Location

**Notes** → **Settings** (⌘,) → **Sort Notes By**

Or in the app:
**View** menu → **Sort By**

## Related: Group by Date

Enable date grouping for visual organization:

```bash
# Group into Today, Yesterday, Previous 7 Days, etc.
defaults write com.apple.Notes GroupNotesByDate -bool true
```

This creates sections like:
- **Today**
- **Yesterday**
- **Previous 7 Days**
- **Previous 30 Days**
- **Older**

## Complete Notes Organization

```bash
# Optimal organization setup
defaults write com.apple.Notes NotesSortOrder -int 1
defaults write com.apple.Notes GroupNotesByDate -bool true
defaults write com.apple.Notes FoldersSortOrder -int 1
```

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Sort order not changing | Restart Notes app |
| Notes not in folders | Sorting applies within folders |
| Pinned notes affected | Pinned notes always stay at top |
