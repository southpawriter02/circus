# Notes Sort Order

Control how notes are sorted in the list.

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Domain** | `com.apple.Notes` |
| **Key** | `NotesSortOrder` |
| **Type** | Integer |
| **Default Value** | `1` |
| **Our Setting** | `1` |

## Description

Controls how notes are ordered within folders in the Notes app. You can sort by when notes were last edited, when they were created, or alphabetically by title.

## Values

| Value | Sort Order |
|-------|------------|
| `1` | **Date Edited** (default) — Most recently modified first |
| `2` | **Date Created** — Newest created first |
| `3` | **Title** — Alphabetical order |

## Our Configuration

**Set to**: `1` — Sort by date edited.

### Why Date Edited?

1. **Active notes** — Recent work at the top
2. **Natural flow** — Current projects visible
3. **Quick access** — Find what you're working on
4. **Context** — See what you touched last

### When to Use Other Options

- **Date Created**: Preserve original order of notes
- **Title**: Organized reference/documentation notes

## Code Examples

```bash
# Read current value
defaults read com.apple.Notes NotesSortOrder

# Sort by date edited (recommended)
defaults write com.apple.Notes NotesSortOrder -int 1

# Sort by date created
defaults write com.apple.Notes NotesSortOrder -int 2

# Sort by title (alphabetical)
defaults write com.apple.Notes NotesSortOrder -int 3

# Delete (reset to default)
defaults delete com.apple.Notes NotesSortOrder
```

## UI Location

**Notes** → **Settings** (⌘,) → **Sort Notes By**

Or: **View** menu → **Sort By**

## Grouping by Date

Related setting to group notes by time period:

```bash
# Group notes by date (Today, Yesterday, etc.)
defaults write com.apple.Notes GroupNotesByDate -bool true
```

When enabled, notes appear under headers:
- Today
- Yesterday
- Previous 7 Days
- Previous 30 Days
- Older

## Folder Sorting

Separate setting for folder order:

```bash
# Folder sort: 1=Manual, 2=Name A-Z, 3=Name Z-A
defaults write com.apple.Notes FoldersSortOrder -int 1
```

## Compatibility

- **macOS**: 10.14+
- **iCloud**: Syncs with iOS Notes
- **Note**: Setting applies per-device

## Source File
