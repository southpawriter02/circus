# Xcode Continue Building After Errors

Continue compiling other files after encountering build errors.

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Domain** | `com.apple.dt.Xcode` |
| **Key** | `IDEBuildingContinueBuildingAfterErrors` |
| **Type** | Boolean |
| **Default Value** | `false` |
| **Our Setting** | `true` |

## Description

By default, Xcode stops building as soon as it encounters a compile error. When this setting is enabled, Xcode continues compiling other files and targets, showing you ALL errors at once instead of stopping at the first one.

## Values

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `true` | **Continue building** — Show all errors at once |
| `false` | **Stop on first error** (default) — Fix one by one |

## The Workflow Difference

### Default Behavior (Stop on Error)

```
Build started...
❌ Error in FileA.swift:42
Build failed.

[You fix FileA.swift]
Build started...
❌ Error in FileB.swift:17
Build failed.

[You fix FileB.swift]
Build started...
❌ Error in FileC.swift:89
Build failed.

... and so on
```

### With Continue Building

```
Build started...
❌ Error in FileA.swift:42
❌ Error in FileB.swift:17
❌ Error in FileC.swift:89
⚠️ Warning in FileD.swift:23
Build failed with 3 errors.

[You see everything at once and fix all issues]
```

## Our Configuration

**Set to**: `true` — See all errors at once.

### Benefits

1. **Full picture** — Understand scope of problems
2. **Batch fixing** — Fix related errors together
3. **Faster iteration** — Fewer build cycles needed
4. **Better planning** — Prioritize fixes effectively

### When Default Is Better

- Very large projects (build time matters)
- Cascading errors (one error causes many false positives)
- Limited screen space for Issues pane

## Code Examples

```bash
# Continue building after errors
defaults write com.apple.dt.Xcode IDEBuildingContinueBuildingAfterErrors -bool true

# Stop at first error (Xcode default)
defaults write com.apple.dt.Xcode IDEBuildingContinueBuildingAfterErrors -bool false
```

## UI Location

**Xcode** → **Settings** (⌘,) → **General** → **Continue building after errors**

## Viewing All Errors

With this enabled, use the Issue Navigator (⌘5) to see all errors:
- Red icons = Errors
- Yellow icons = Warnings
- Click to jump to location
- Filter by type

## Related Build Settings

```bash
# Also show build duration
defaults write com.apple.dt.Xcode ShowBuildOperationDuration -bool true

# Show runtime issues during debugging
defaults write com.apple.dt.Xcode IDEShowRuntimeIssues -bool true
```

## Performance Note

Continuing to build after errors uses more CPU (compiling files that may not be needed). On massive projects, this can add build time. For most projects, the difference is negligible.

## Compatibility

- **Xcode**: 8.0 and later
- **Applies to**: All build operations

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Still stops on first error | Restart Xcode after setting |
| Too many errors shown | Some are cascading; fix root cause first |
| Build takes longer | Expected; compiles all files |

## Source File

**File**: [`defaults/applications/xcode.sh`](../../../../defaults/applications/xcode.sh)

```bash
run_defaults "com.apple.dt.Xcode" "IDEBuildingContinueBuildingAfterErrors" "-bool" "true"
```
