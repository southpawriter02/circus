# Stage 10: Dotfiles Deployment
#
# This script is the core of the installation process. It handles the backup
# of existing dotfiles, the creation of necessary directories, and the copying
# and symlinking of the new dotfiles from the repository.
#
# Its responsibilities include:
#
#   10.1. Checking for and backing up existing dotfiles.
#   10.2. Removing any conflicting dotfiles.
#   10.3. Creating all required directories for the new configuration.
#   10.4. Copying the new dotfiles from the repository.
#   10.5. Creating placeholder files as needed.
#   10.6. Configuring the new dotfiles (e.g., injecting variables).
#   10.7. Copying any non-script assets (e.g., templates, images).
#   10.8. Creating all necessary symbolic links.
