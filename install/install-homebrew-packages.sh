# Install Homebrew Packages
#
# This script will contain the logic for installing packages and applications
# using Homebrew.
#
# UNUSED CODE NOTICE:
#   This script is NOT currently referenced in install.sh's INSTALL_STAGES array.
#   Note: Stage 03 (03-homebrew-installation.sh) implements Homebrew package
#   installation using `brew bundle` with Brewfile support.
#   
#   RECOMMENDATION: Either:
#   1. Remove this placeholder (Stage 03 covers this functionality), OR
#   2. Consolidate any unique functionality with Stage 03.
#
# ==============================================================================

#
# This is a placeholder for the Homebrew installation logic.
#
# TODO: Implement the actual logic for installing Homebrew packages. This might involve:
# 1. Reading a list of packages from a Brewfile.
# 2. Running `brew bundle` to install all the packages in the Brewfile.
#

msg_info "Installing Homebrew packages..."

# For now, we will just print a message indicating that this step is a placeholder.
