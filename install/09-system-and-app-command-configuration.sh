# Stage 9: System and App Command Configuration
#
# This script configures low-level system settings using macOS-specific
# command-line utilities. This allows for fine-grained control over system
# behavior.
#
# Its responsibilities include:
#
#   9.1. Configuring system settings via `systemsetup`.
#   9.2. Setting boot variables with `nvram`.
#   9.3. Managing power settings with `pmset`.
