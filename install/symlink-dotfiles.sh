# Dotfiles Symlinking
#
# This script will contain the logic for symlinking the dotfiles from the
# repository to the user's home directory.

# ==============================================================================

#
# This is a placeholder for the dotfiles symlinking logic.
#
# TODO: Implement the actual symlinking logic here. This might involve:
# 1. Defining a list of files/directories to be symlinked.
# 2. Iterating through the list.
# 3. Creating a symbolic link in the home directory for each item, pointing
#    to the corresponding file/directory in the repository.
#

msg_info "Symlinking dotfiles..."

# For now, we will just print a message indicating that this step is a placeholder.
