# Set macOS Defaults
#
# This script will contain the logic for configuring macOS system defaults.
#
# UNUSED CODE NOTICE:
#   This script is NOT currently referenced in install.sh's INSTALL_STAGES array.
#   Note: Stage 04 (04-macos-system-settings.sh) and Stage 11 
#   (11-defaults-and-additional-configuration.sh) implement similar functionality.
#   
#   RECOMMENDATION: Either:
#   1. Consolidate with existing Stage 04 or Stage 11 functionality, OR
#   2. Remove this placeholder if not needed (existing stages cover this).
#
# ==============================================================================

#
# This is a placeholder for the macOS defaults logic.
#
# TODO: Implement the actual logic for setting macOS defaults. This might involve:
# 1. Running a series of `defaults write` commands to change system settings.
# 2. Sourcing a separate, dedicated script for macOS configuration (e.g., system/macos.sh).
#

msg_info "Setting macOS defaults..."

# For now, we will just print a message indicating that this step is a placeholder.
