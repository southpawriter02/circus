# Dotfiles Backup

# This script will contain the logic for backing up existing dotfiles before
# the new ones are symlinked into place.

# ==============================================================================

#
# This is a placeholder for the dotfiles backup logic.
#
# TODO: Implement the actual backup logic here. This might involve:
# 1. Identifying which dotfiles already exist in the home directory.
# 2. Creating a timestamped backup directory.
# 3. Moving the existing dotfiles into the backup directory.
#

msg_info "Backing up existing dotfiles..."

# For now, we will just print a message indicating that this step is a placeholder.
